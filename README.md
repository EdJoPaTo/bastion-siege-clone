# Bastion Siege Clone

This is a project trying to clone [Bastion Siege](https://t.me/BastionSiegeBot).

The challenge of this project is to use [telegraf-inline-menu](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/telegraf-inline-menu) in order to get a cool Telegram Bot within a short amount of time.
For localisation [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) Labels are used as they provide a wide range of languages and context information (which is sadly currently not used besides the descriptions and the name selector).

The logic of BastionSiege is used from [Bastion Siege Logic](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/bastion-siege-logic).

I do not intend to steal the work of [Bastion Siege](https://t.me/BastionSiegeBot).
Sadly the new version of [Bastion Siege v2](https://t.me/BSv2Bot) does only support Russian.
This lead to the idea of this Bot as an April Joke 2019: [Bastion Siege v3](https://t.me/BSv3Bot) with many languages.
